# Polarization Enhanced Texture Analysis: With Applications to Precision Agriculture

This is my Masters Thesis. Produced during my Graduate studies in Electrical Engineering
at Manhattan College.

The final pdf is hosted on my website here: [](https://nicholasericksen.com/assets/Thesis.pdf)

This study was into the polarization properties of light combined with various imaging techniques.
It looks at spectral results through the use of RGB filters embedded in camera systems as 
well as Grey Level Co-Occurence Matrices for determining the relative water content of plant leaves.

Traditionally the process of determining the RWC of plants is a manual and tediuous process requiring 
long hours and days of drying leaves in an oven and weighing them in order to determine there relative water content.

The use of imaging techniques is a new an novel approach to this area of study.
