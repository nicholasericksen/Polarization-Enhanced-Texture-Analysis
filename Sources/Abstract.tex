As agricultural inputs, such as water and fertilizer, become more scarce in the future, a higher level of precision will be required when utilizing these resources. Remote sensing is a field that has aimed to understand data from radiation reflected from vegetation.  Remote determination of water content
of this vegetation remains a long term goal.  Furthermore as agricultural production has also shifted to indoor
growing environments, the use of indoor sensors at smaller scales could be useful for determining the
physiological status of crops. In this study the use of texture, polarization and pseudo-spectral features captured in
acquired images are shown to be useful for the successful classification of
three different deciduous tree species common to the northeastern part of the
United States using a linear support vector classifier. The observations
are extended to the intra-class variance of the derived features and are shown
to be useful for the prediction of the relative water content of individual leaves when
analyzed using support vector regression.
