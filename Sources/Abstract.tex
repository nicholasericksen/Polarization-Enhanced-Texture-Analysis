The use of texture, polarization and pseudo-spectral features captured in
acquired images are shown to be useful for the successful classification of
3 different deciduous tree species common to the northeastern part of the
United States using a linear support vector classifier. The observations
are extended to the intra-class variance of the derived features and are shown
to be useful for the prediction of the relative water content of leaves when
analyzed using support vector regression.
