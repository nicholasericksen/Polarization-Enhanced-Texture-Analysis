A plant's health is greatly determined by the availability of light, water, and key nutrients in the soil.  These elements are the fundamental inputs to photosynthesis, the process plants utilize to turn light energy into chemical energy for growth.  Nitrogen, Potassium, and Phosphorus are fertilizers (agricultural inputs) that can incur large costs when applied over hectares of farmland, but are needed for healthy plant growth and cell reproduction.

Water is also an essential agricultural input needed for plant photosynthesis and aids in nutrient transport.  Droughts are becoming a global epidemic and precision water management is becoming pivotal for a crops' survival.

The layers of a deciduous leaf contain protection mechanisms, transport systems, and reaction centers for the process of photosynthesis.

The cuticle wax layer, upper epidermis, and mesophyll layer are the first layers of light interaction on the adaxial surface of the leaf.

The cuticle wax layer provides “the most critical adaptive trait for survival … the ability to retain water in increasingly dehydrating habitats” \cite{cuticle}.  It is the first line of defense for plants and acts as a barrier between water transpiration.

The mesophyll layers contain chloroplasts that convert light energy into chemical energy and consists of two parts. The palisade mesophyll is made up of elongated, organized, compact cells that contain a large number of the chloroplasts.  The spongy mesophyll is irregular in shape and has a large amount of space between its cells to facilitate air and gas exchange [TODO find source].

The upper epidermis consists of very few chloroplasts, and allows most of the light to pass through to the mesophyll layers.
