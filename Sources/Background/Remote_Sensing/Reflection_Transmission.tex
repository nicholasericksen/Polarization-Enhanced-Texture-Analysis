\subsection{Reflection and Transmission of Light and Leaves}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The reflectance of light off of a leaf is dependent on many different factors.  As plants undergo stressful conditions, there reflectance and transmittances change.  In general, as photosynthetic activity decreases, the reflection off of the surface increases.  As a results there is also less transmission.  The growth stage of the leaf is also import as younger leaves have not fully developed all of the internal complex structures.  As the number of complex structures increases, there is an increase in the number of air wax interfaces to cause more randomized reflection and refraction [2].

Leaves that succumb to disease also may become deformed and further alter the response recorded from the canopy layer.

It has been shown [26, 30] that leafs are not purely diffuse or purely specular reflectors of light.  There response is best modelled as a combination of both components.
